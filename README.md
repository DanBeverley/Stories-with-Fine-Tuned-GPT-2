# Stories-with-Fine-Tuned-GPT-2

The notebook is related to generating stories based on a given prompt using a fine-tuned version of GPT-2. From the first part of the file, we can infer that it uses libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `torch`, and `transformers`. Here's a summary of what we need to build the GitHub repository structure and the `requirements.txt`:

### Key Components:
- The project involves **fine-tuning GPT-2** using the **Hugging Face `transformers` library**.
- It also imports **PyTorch (`torch`)** for handling the model and **tqdm** for progress bars.
- **Logging** is used for tracking the training process, and **argparse** might be used for command-line argument parsing.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- PyTorch
- Numpy, Pandas
- tqdm

Python Script: `stories-with-fine-tuned-gpt.py`:

You can export the code from the notebook into a Python script, adjusting it to handle command-line arguments for training and generation.
